- No need to illustrate your report with theoretical results we all already know from theoretical lectures. 
- Please use decimal points instead of commas!!! 
- Errors in added absorptions? 
- Making average calculations for all the microphones of some configurations makes absolutely no sense!!! 
- Average values of RT with their associated errors for all the similar configurations? 
- Comments about the different directivity factors considered? 
- Optimum RT is definitevely higher than the experimental one!!! 
- Please comment about this last issue!!! 
. More graphical comparisons between different configurations would be welcome!!! 
- Comments about Schroeder's frequency?
