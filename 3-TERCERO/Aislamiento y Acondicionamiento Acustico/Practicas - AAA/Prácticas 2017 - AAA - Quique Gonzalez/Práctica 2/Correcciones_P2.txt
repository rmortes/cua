- No data about reverberation times is asked. 
- Take care with the error expression (try to follow the general expression criterion). 
- Graphical comparison between the different configurations of the same material? This was a very important part of the lab experience that you have not addressed. 
- Graphical comparison between the absoprtion coefficients of the different materials? 
- Your comments are all right but the lab report is a bit poor, more comparison will be definitevely welcome. 
- References for the absorption coefficient theoretical values?
