A set of libraries from various sources given in import format
so each user can select which are interesting. There is also
a library called Abslib_full.DAT that contain all of the data
below (164 properties), to use it just select it in Preferences.
For tips on further data go to the users' www page.

Notes:

  Scattering coefficients have been added where appropriate, 
  e.g. for audiences or chairs.

  Absorption coeffcient values > 100% are set to 99%.
  Values > 100% is an artefact of the measuremet method used and
  can't be used in prediction.

  All data is provided "as is" and it is strongly recommended
  that the reference works, if possible, are purchased and used
  as guidelines for the application of the data. The data here
  can only serve as initial estimates. Many material descriptions
  are in the original references very short or cryptic and it is
  sometimes not indicated e.g. what is behind (backing) a material
  or construction. In practice, values can vary widely between
  materials with seemingly similar descriptions. Translations are
  sometimes tricky (e.g. from Petersen and Karlen references) and
  may give unclear or incorrect descriptions.

  If several similar materials are given in the references they are
  named e.g. PLASTER10, PLASTER11, PLASTER30 etc. The variation of
  values is also useful information.

  Some materials included in the references have simply been left
  out because lack of a clear enough description (in many cases the
  value are given as typical values rather than for a specific
  detailed case).
